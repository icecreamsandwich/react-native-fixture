## Requirements

Supported target operating systems are >= Android 4.1 (API 16) and >= iOS 9.0. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS by default (tools like [Expo](https://expo.io) can be used to get around this).

## Building your first React Native app

Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). The recommended way to install React Native depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:

- [Trying out React Native](https://snack.expo.io/BJ-uC-nrb)
- [Creating a New Application](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Adding React Native to an Existing Application](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html)
